### Abstract

Global Theories of Change (ToCs) can provide broad, overarching guidance for conservation and sustainable use of Earth’s ecosystems. However, broad guidance alone cannot inform how conservation actions will lead to desired socio-ecological outcomes. Here, we develop a framework for translating a global-scale ToC into focussed, ecosystem-specific ToCs that consider feasibility of actions, as determined by national socioeconomic and political context (i.e., enabling conditions). We used coastal wetlands as a case study for developing the framework and identified six distinct multinational profiles of enabling conditions (‘enabling profiles’) for their conservation. For countries belonging to profiles with high internal capacity to enable conservation, we described plausible ToCs that involved strengthening policy and regulation. Alternatively, for profiles with low internal enabling capacity, plausible ToCs typically required formalising community-led conservation. Our ‘enabling profile’ framework can be applied to other ecosystems to help operationalise the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and meet Sustainable Development Goals.

### Scripts

#### Run a Bayesian latent variable model (LVM) on raw indicator data to gap-fill missing indicator values by country

1.  01_lvm-model.R
    -   The full model
2.  01_lvm-model-no-rams-manage.R
    -   The model without the *Ramsar Management* indicator (to assess robustness to violation of the 'missing at random' assumption)
3.  01_lvm-model-no-cons-spend.R
    -   The model without the *Conservation Spending* indicator (to assess robustness to violation of the 'missing at random' assumption)

#### Calculate the median predicted standard normal indicator values from the posterior distribution of the LVM, for each indicator and country

1.  02_predict-indicator-vals.R
    -   Obtain the posterior distributions of latent variable scores and coefficients for each indicator and country (i.e. MCMC samples) to calculate the entire range of predicted standard normal indicator values and extract the median value. Repeat for each lvm model listed above.
    -   Also extract every 96th predicted value from the entire range of predicted values for each indicator and country to assess Enabling Profile robustness (see 09_cluster-robustness.R)

#### Check that the raw and predicted standard normal indicator values are strongly positively correlated

1.  03_raw-vs-predicted.R

#### Evaluate robustness to violation of 'missing at random' assumption for *Ramsar Management* and *Conservation Spending* indicators

1.  04_evaluate-MAR-consspend.R
    -   Assess robustness of model parameter estimation to violation of the 'missing at random' assumption for the *Conservation Spending* indicator (Fig S3)
2.  04_evaluate-MAR-ramsmanage.R
    -   Assess robustness of model parameter estimation to violation of the 'missing at random' assumption for the *Ramsar Management* indicator (Fig S4)

#### Run a cluster analysis on the predicted standard normal indicator values to classify countries into Enabling Profiles and produce a map

1.  05_cluster.R
    -   Fig 2A

#### Determine the importance of indicators for classifying countries into Enabling Profiles with classification trees

1.  06_trees.R
    -   Fig 2B and C

#### Identify and map the main drivers of mangrove and seagrass loss in each Enabling Profile

1.  07_drivers-loss.R
    -   Fig 3 and 4

#### Produce an ordination of standard normal indicator values for each country, and group by Enabling Profile

1.  08_ordination.R
    -   Fig S1

#### Assess the robustness of Enabling Profiles

1.  09_cluster-robustness.R
    -   Fig S6 and S7

#### Validate missing value interpolation

1.  10_imputation-validation.R

#### Simulate missing not at random and assess interpolative capacity

1.  11_simulate-mnar.R
2.  12_plot-sims.R
    -   Fig S5

#### Compare country pairwise clustering differences when variables are removed

1.  13_compare-clusters.R
